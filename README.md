The code is fully commented, and the only modification required is to change the directory at the beginning of the code.

2. Estimation results are saved in LaTeX files in the output folder:
Original results (Table 2): psi_time_varying.tex and kappa_time_varying.tex
Extended version results: psi_time_varying_ext.tex and kappa_time_varying_ext.tex

3. Hypothesis test results are saved in a text file: t_test_results.txt

4. Conclusions and results are summarized in the PDF file: Assignment 4 â€“ Computation.pdf
